# Species Classification Model (Cat vs Dog)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that implements a deep learning model for species classification, specifically differentiating between cats and dogs. The model uses images and is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset
- The model is trained on the [Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) dataset from Kaggle.
- The dataset consists of a large collection of labeled images of cats and dogs.

## Model Architecture
- The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.
- It includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- The final layer uses a softmax activation function to classify the input image as either a cat or a dog.

## Usage
- Download the [Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) from Kaggle.
- Extract the dataset to a local directory.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file in this repository.
- Update the file paths in the notebook to point to the dataset directory.
- Run the notebook to train and evaluate the species classification model.

## Requirements
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (version 2.0 or higher)
- Keras (version 2.0 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- The results can be viewed and analyzed within the Jupyter Notebook.
